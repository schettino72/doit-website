===================
tutorial 1 - basics
===================

This tutorial demonstrates how to use ``doit`` to create simple computational pipeline.

The goal is to create a graph of python module imports in a package.
`graphviz <http://graphviz.org/>`_'s **dot** tool will be used to generate the graph.

As example the `requests <https://github.com/requests/requests>`_ package will be used. The result is the image below:

.. image:: _static/requests.png


In the image an arrow represents an import from one module to another. For example in the left side of image you can see an arrow from `requests.status_codes` to `requests.structures`. This comes from the following line in `status_code.py`:

.. code-block:: python3

   from .structures import LookupDict


Drawing an "import" dependency graph can be very useful to understand how the code in a package is organized.
It may also help you identify potential problems like circular imports.

There are three main steps to generate this graph:

1) read each python module and list it's imports
2) generate a `dot` (text format) file representing the graph
3) generate an image (PNG) from the `dot` file


setup
=====

required python packages
------------------------

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install doit pygraphviz import_deps


sample project
--------------

First create a directory that will contain the projects to be analyzed.

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir projects

Then clone the ``requests`` project

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd projects
   $ git clone git@github.com:requests/requests.git
   $ cd ..



finding a module's import
=========================

Using `import_deps <https://github.com/schettino72/import-deps>`_ list all (intra-packages) imports from a module:

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m import_deps projects/requests/requests/models.py
    requests._internal_utils
    requests.auth
    requests.compat
    requests.cookies
    requests.exceptions
    requests.hooks
    requests.status_codes
    requests.structures
    requests.utils


The output contains one imported module per line.


doit task
---------

Next step we are going to wrap the above script in a ``doit`` *task*.
In ``doit`` tasks are defined in a plain python module, by default called ``dodo.py``.

For example a trivial task to execute the script above and save its output into a file would be:


.. code-block:: python3
   :caption: dodo.py

    def task_imports():
        return {
            'actions': ['python -m import_deps '
                        'projects/requests/requests/models.py > requests.models.deps'],
        }


In this module you write functions that are **task-creators**,
the role of these functions is not to execute tasks but to return task's metadata.
**task-creators** are any function whose name starts with ``task_``.
A task name is taken from the function name,
in this case the name is ``imports``.

The most important *Task* metadata is ``actions``, this defines what will be done when a task is executed.

Note that ``actions`` is a list where its element are a string with a shell command.


task execution
--------------

``doit`` command line by default will execute all tasks defined in ``dodo.py`` module in the current directory.

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   .  imports


The output reports that the ``imports`` task was executed.
You can check that a file ``requests.models.deps`` was created with
a list of modules imported by ``requests.models``.


incremental computation
-----------------------

One of the main purposes in the usage of ``doit`` is to make use
of **up-to-date** checks to decide if tasks *needs* to be executed or not.

In this case as long as the input file is not modified we are certain
that the same output would be generated...

When dealing with files, task's metadata ``file_dep`` and ``targets`` can be used:


.. task_imports, line 11 is clean
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 5-10,12


Note how ``actions`` can make use of variable substitution for
``%(dependencies)s`` and ``%(targets)s``.

Now let's execute it again:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   .  imports

And then, a second time:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   --  imports


Note that the second time there is a ``--`` instead of ``.`` preceding the task name.
This means that the task was not executed, ``doit`` understood that
the task output would be the same as previously generated,
so it does not execute the task again.

.. warning::

   When ``doit`` *loads* a ``dodo.py`` file it executes all *task-creator* functions in order to generate all tasks metadata.
   A task's ``action`` is only executed if the task is selected to run and not **up-to-date**.

   Expensive computation should always be done on task's ``action``
   and never on the body of a **task-creator** function.


rules for up-to-date checks on files
------------------------------------


file_dep
^^^^^^^^

``doit`` uses the *md5* of ``file_dep`` to determine if a dependency is changed.


.. code-block:: console

   $ touch projects/requests/requests/models.py
   $ doit
   -- imports
   $ echo "# comment" >> projects/requests/requests/models.py
   $ doit
   .  imports


Note that simply changing a file timestamp would not trigger a new execution.


targets
^^^^^^^

For ``targets``, it only checks if the target exists.
So if a target is removed it will be re-created even without changes on dependencies.

.. code-block:: console

   $ rm requests.models.deps
   $ doit
   .  imports



graphviz dot
============


Next step we will create a `graphviz <http://graphviz.org/>`_'s ``dot`` file.
``dot`` is a language to describe to graphs.

Code below defines a python function to read a file containing
import dependencies (as generated by previously defined ``imports`` task).


.. module_to_dot()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 1-3,14-15,18-27


Task with python action
-----------------------

Next we define the task ``dot``, it is similar to previous task...
but note that instead of passing a string with a shell command
we directly pass the previously created python function ``module_to_dot``.



.. task_dot()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 28-33,35


Also note the function takes the special parameters ``dependencies`` and ``targets``, those values will be injected by ``doit``.


.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   -- imports
   .  dot


To indicate a failure, a python-action should return the value ``False`` or raise an exception.



graph image
-----------

Finally lets add another task to generate an image from the `dot` file using the graphviz command line tool.


.. task_draw()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 38-43,45



.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   -- imports
   -- dot
   .  draw


Opening the file ``requests.models.png`` you should get the image below:

.. image:: _static/requests.models.png



doit command line
=================


``doit`` has a rich (and extensible) command line to manipulate your tasks. So far we have only executed ``doit`` without any parameters...

``doit`` command line takes the form of ``doit <sub-command> <options> <arguments>``,
where ``options`` and ``arguments`` are specific to the ``sub-command``.

If no sub-command is specified the default command ``run`` is used.
``run`` executes tasks...


doit help
---------

``doit help`` will list all available sub-commands.

You can get help for a specific sub-command with ``doit help <sub-command>``, i.e. ``doit help run``.

You can also get help for the task metadata fields with ``doit help task``.


doit list
---------

The command ``list`` displays the list of known tasks:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit list
   dot       generate a graphviz's dot graph from module imports
   draw      generate image from a dot file
   imports   find imports from a python module


Note how the docstring from *task-creators* functions were used as task's description.


info
----

The ``info`` command can be used to get more information from a specific task.
Information about it's metadata, and it is state (whether it is up-to-date or not).


.. code-block:: console

   $ doit info imports

   imports

   find imports from a python module

   status     : up-to-date

   file_dep   :
     - projects/requests/requests/models.py

   targets    :
     - requests.models.deps


run
---

``run`` is the default command, and usually not explicitly typed.
So ``$ doit`` and ``$ doit run`` do exactly the same thing.

Without any parameters ``run`` will execute all of your tasks.
You can also select which tasks to be executed by passing a sequence of tasks names.

For example if you want to execute only the ``imports`` task you would type:


.. code-block:: console

   $ doit imports
   -- imports


Note that even if you explicitly pass the name of task to be executed,
``doit`` will actually execute the task only if it is not **up-to-date**.

You can also pass more than one task:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit imports dot
   -- imports
   -- dot


Another important point to take notice is that even
if you specify only one task ``doit`` will run all of the dependencies of the specified task.

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit dot
   -- imports
   -- dot


Note how the ``imports`` task was run because task ``dot`` has ``file_dep`` that is a target of ``imports`` task.


clean
-----

A common use-case is to be able to "revert" the operations done by a task.
``doit`` provides the ``clean`` command for that.

By default it does nothing... You need to add a parameter ``clean`` to task metadata. For the most common case where you just want to remove the created targets, just pass the value ``True``.

You can also write custom ``actions`` (shell or python) of what should be done as a value to ``clean`` field.

Add ``clean`` to all defined tasks, like:

.. task_draw()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 38-45
   :emphasize-lines: 7


Executing ``clean``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit clean
   draw - removing file 'requests.models.png'
   dot - removing file 'requests.models.dot'
   imports - removing file 'requests.models.deps'


Since targets were removed this will force the tasks to be executed on next ``run``.

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   .  imports
   .  dot
   .  draw



forget
------

``doit`` will look for changes in dependencies, but not changes in your code...
While developing a task it is common to want to force the execution of task after making changes in the code.

For example lets change the colors of nodes in graph:

.. module_to_dot()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_1.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 14-21
   :emphasize-lines: 3-4


To force its execution we need to ``doit`` to ``forget`` its state like:

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit forget dot
   forgetting dot

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit
   -- imports
   .  dot
   .  draw


.. image:: _static/requests.models-blue.png


.. note::

   Another option force execution of task after code changes is to use `run``'s command option ``-a/--always-execute``. That will ignore the **up-to-date** check and always execute tasks.


Code :download:`dodo.py <tutorial/tuto_1_1.py>`.


Pipelines
=========

So far we have build a traditional "file" based pipeline where one task's target is used as a dependency in another task.

While ``doit`` provides first-class support for file based pipelines, they are not required.

get module imports - python
---------------------------

Let's rewrite the ``imports`` task to use python action:

.. task_imports()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_2.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 4-19
   :emphasize-lines: 8,15



Function ``get_imports`` is used as task's action.
It returns a dictionary, this will be saved by ``doit`` in its internal database. The returned dictionary must contain only values that can be encoded in JSON.

Note that the parameter ``module_path`` is passed into task definition of ``actions``.
Instead of just specifying a callable it takes a tuple *(callable, args, kwargs)*.

.. note::

   Note in this example for simplicity we are using ``doit`` internal database but it is also possible to use any other external database or data source.



getargs
-------

The task parameter ``getargs`` can be used to specify values to be retrieved that are computed in another task.
It is a dictionary where the *key* is the parameter name used in this task's action parameter.
It's value is 2-value tuple where the first item is the task name, and the second is the value name (key in the returned dictionary).



.. task_dot()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_2.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 22-38
   :emphasize-lines: 1,14,15


Note how ``module_to_dot`` takes 3 parameters:

- ``source``: value is passed directly when task's actions is defined
- ``imports``: value is taken from ``imports`` task result
- ``targets``: values is taken from Task metadata


Everything should work as before, but without the creation of intermediate files.

``doit`` can determine if task ``imports`` is **up-to-date** even without a target file (it just look at the ``file_dep``).

``doit`` can also determine if ``dot`` is **up-to-date** by comparing the value returned by ``imports`` (instead of checking for file changes, it checks for changes in the JSON object).

Code :download:`dodo.py <tutorial/tuto_1_2.py>`.


package imports
===============

So far we are creating a graph of only one module.
Let's process all modules in the package.

``doit`` has the concept of a **task-group**.
A task group performs the same operation over a set of instances.
To create a task group the task-creator function should ``yield`` one or more task dictionaries with task metadata.

Note that each task is still independent.
Since each task needs to be independently identified an extra parameter ``name`` must be provided.


.. task_imports()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_3.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 8-22
   :emphasize-lines: 4,11,12


Sub-tasks (items of task group) by default are not reported on ``list`` command. They be displayed using the ``--all`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit list
   dot       generate a graphviz's dot graph from module imports
   draw      generate image from a dot file
   imports   find imports from a python module

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit list --all imports
   imports                            find imports from a python module
   imports:requests.__init__
   imports:requests.__version__
   imports:requests._internal_utils
   imports:requests.adapters
   imports:requests.api
   imports:requests.auth
   imports:requests.certs
   imports:requests.compat
   imports:requests.cookies
   imports:requests.exceptions
   imports:requests.help
   imports:requests.hooks
   imports:requests.models
   imports:requests.packages
   imports:requests.sessions
   imports:requests.status_codes
   imports:requests.structures
   imports:requests.utils


Note the task name is composed by the (base name) group task name
followed by a colon `:` and the ``name`` specified as a parameter.

From command line a single task can executed like::

  $ doit imports:requests.models
  .  imports:requests.models


getargs from group-task
-----------------------

``getargs`` can also be used to get values from a *group-task*.
The difference is that its value will be a dictionary where the
key is the sub-task name:


.. task_dot()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_3.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 25-41
   :emphasize-lines: 5,15


Finally adjust task ``draw``.

.. task_draw()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_3.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 44-51
   :emphasize-lines: 4-5


Running ``doit`` you should get the file ``requests.png`` with the image below:

.. image:: _static/requests.png


Code :download:`dodo.py <tutorial/tuto_1_3.py>`.


printing imports
================

Getting rid of intermediate computation files (like ``requests.models.deps``) was nice...
but sometimes it is nice to be able to quickly list the direct imports from a module.

Let's create another task just print it's output in the terminal.

.. task_print()
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_4.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 12-14, 32-44
   :emphasize-lines: 14-15

Here again we used a **task-group** to create one task per python module. And ``getargs`` to get list of module imports that were already calculated on ``imports`` task.

Also note the usage of two metadata fields not seen before ``uptodate`` and ``verbosity``.


custom `uptodate`
-----------------

So far we have seen how ``doit`` can determine if a task is **up-to-date** by taking into account changes to ``file_dep``, if ``targets`` exist and results from ``getargs``...

While those cover a wide range of use cases, ``doit`` also provides a way to specify completely custom checks for  **up-to-date**, using the ``uptodate`` field.

In this case the ``print`` task actually does not perform any computation, it is being used to display some info to the user.
So this task should be **always** executed.

``update`` will be explained in detail in part 2 of this tutorial.
For now suffice to add value ``False`` to indicate this task will never be considered **up-do-date**.

.. code-block:: python

   'uptodate': [False],


verbosity
---------

``doit`` output (for command ``run``) consists of:

- one line with task name (preceded by `.` or `--`)
- task output

The actual task output displayed can be controlled by ``verbosity``,
there are 3 levels of verbosity.

- 0: both stdout and stderr from task are **NOT** displayed
- 1: only stderr is displayed
- 2: both stdout and stderr are displayed

The default verbosity is `1`.

If ``print`` task was executed with default verbosity we would actually not see any output, so we must force its ``verbosity`` value to ``2``.


.. code-block:: python3

   'verbosity': 2,

.. code-block:: console

   $ doit print:requests.models
   -- imports:requests.models
   .  print:requests.models
   requests._internal_utils
   requests.auth
   requests.compat
   requests.cookies
   requests.exceptions
   requests.hooks
   requests.status_codes
   requests.structures
   requests.utils

Note ``verbosity`` can be overwritten from command-line with option ``-v/--verbosity``.


DOIT_CONFIG
-----------

There is one last problem to be solved.
Since ``print`` is used only to display some information, it should not be executed by default. It should be executed only when explicitly asked.

i.e. when you just run ``doit`` without any parameters it should create the graph image but not print out the information from ``print`` task.

Before I said by default ``doit run`` would execute all tasks.
That is not exactly true... it will execute all *default tasks*.
The default tasks can be controlled by adding a configuration dictionary with the name ``DOIT_CONFIG`` in the `dodo.py`.


.. DOIT_CONFIG
.. literalinclude:: tutorial/tuto_1_4.py
   :language: python3
   :lines: 7-9


Apart from ``default_tasks``, ``DOIT_CONFIG`` can change the default of any command line option. For example you can globally change task's verbosity for all tasks with:

.. code-block:: python3

   DOIT_CONFIG = {
    'default_tasks': ['imports', 'dot', 'draw'],
    'verbosity': 2,
   }


Code :download:`dodo.py <tutorial/tuto_1_4.py>`.



And that's all for part 1 of tutorial :)
